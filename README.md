# WEEK-7-BASIC-DATA-ANALYSIS
# Data Analysis and Visualization Task

This project involves performing data analysis and visualization on a chosen dataset using Python. The following steps are included: loading and exploring the dataset, basic data analysis, and creating different types of visualizations.

## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

1. **Choose a dataset** in CSV format (e.g., Iris dataset, sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).
2. **Load the dataset** using `pandas`.
3. Display the first few rows of the dataset using `.head()` to inspect the data.
4. Explore the structure of the dataset by checking:
   - Data types
   - Any missing values
5. Clean the dataset by either:
   - Filling missing values
   - Dropping rows with missing values

## Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

1. Compute basic statistics of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) using `.describe()`.
2. Perform groupings on a categorical column (e.g., species, region, department) and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.
3. Identify any patterns or interesting findings from your analysis.

## Task 3: Data Visualization

Create at least **four different types of visualizations**:
1. **Line Chart**: Show trends over time (e.g., a time-series of sales data).
2. **Bar Chart**: Compare a numerical value across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
3. **Histogram**: Show the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., petal length distribution).
4. **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).

### Customization of Plots:
- Customize your plots using the `matplotlib` library to add titles, axis labels, and legends.
- You can use `seaborn` for additional plotting styles to make your charts more visually appealing.

## Error Handling

Ensure you handle possible errors during:
- **File Reading**: Handle errors such as file not found, or incorrect file format.
- **Missing Data**: Handle missing data properly by filling or dropping missing values.
- **Incorrect Data Types**: Handle incorrect data types that might arise during the analysis.

## Submission

- Ensure your submission is complete with all necessary code and explanations.
- Make sure each plot is properly labeled and provides insights into the dataset.
